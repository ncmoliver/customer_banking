## Week 3: Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp
This week we were tasked using a Class in python to create a banking program that calculates interest earned based on a customer's input.
## 🗃️ Project Files
This program contains 1 executable file and 3 modular files.
**customer_banking.py | Executable**  
    The main project file which takes in user input and passes it through the class created in Account.py, which is imported into both cd_account.py and saving_account.py. Returning two values, the interest earned on the account and the updated acccount balance.
    <hr> 
**Account.py | Modular File**    
    Holds all banking account functions, used in for calculating interest and updating account balance.
    <li><b>savings_account.py | Modular File</b></li> 
    Using an instance of the Account class, we pass in user input into to calculate interest earned on a customer's savings account and returns the interest earned and the updated account balance.
    <li><b>cd_account.py | Modular File</b></li> Using an instance of the Account class, we pass in user input into to calculate interest earned on a customer's cd account and returns the interest earned and the updated account balance.

## 🌟 Features 
**Agile Practices** - Use of a class and functions to promote readability, reusability, and encapsulation.    
&nbsp;
**User-friendly** - Easy for users to interact with program.

## 📝 Execution Steps
1. If you have not done so already, CLONE git repository:</li>
