# Customer Banking Program

Welcome to the Customer Banking Program. This program was created using Python in my fourth week as a Bootcamp student at the University of Chapel Hill - Artificial Intelligence. In this assignment, we were tasked with finalizing a customer banking app. 

## Overview / Inspiration
My personal inspiration while completing this project was to provide as much user-friendly additions as possible while learning and incorportaing object oriented programming. During this project, the challenges that I overcame during this assingnment were:
    1. Connecting how a Class (assigned in one file), was able to truly become a blueprint for the other files. I learned that from setting this blueprint, it must be followed and adhered to in order to receive the expected output. 
    I noticed that both files were executing the same functions, however I had trouble getting the output to display after returning the calculated interest and updated balance. 
    2. Instances: Instances was a new topic for me. When creating an instance of the Account class, I learned how this can be used to almost reiterate the blueprint provided. 
## What It Does
The functionalities of this app is designed to keep track of two accounts, a CD Account and a Savings Account. Two functions are used to calculate the interest earned on an account and update the account balance. 
## The Process
1. The user is prompted to enter their Savings Account information
    * Account Balance
    * Interest Rate
    * Maturity (months)
2. Automatically calculates the interest earned on the account and updates the account balance.
3. Displays the updated account balance to the user and the interest earned on the savings account. 
4. The process repeates for the CD Account. 
## Program Features

## Agile Practices
While creating this program, I learned that there are many benefits to using classes and instances:
* Modularity: Breaking larger code into smaller, more manageable parts.
* Reusability: The use of classes and instances reduces redundancy in repeating code.
* Encapsulation: Classes allow you to hold attributes and methods in one single place.
* Readability: Object oriented programming promotes code that is easier to read, follow, and understand. 
* Scalability: As the project grows, you can extend and modify classes without affecting the rerst of the code.
