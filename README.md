## Week 3: Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp
This week we were tasked using a Class in python to create a banking program that calculates interest earned based on a customer's input.
## üóÉÔ∏è Project Files
This program contains 1 executable file and 3 modular files 
     
**customer_banking.py | Executable**  
The main project file takes user input and passes it through the class created in Account.py, which is imported into both cd_account.py and saving_account.py. Each function within the class returns two values, the interest earned on the account and the updated acccount balance.

***

**Account.py | Modular File**    
Holds all banking account functions, used in for calculating interest and updating account balance.   

**savings_account.py | Modular File**    
Using an instance of the Account class, we pass in user input into to calculate interest earned on a customer's savings account and returns the interest earned and the updated account balance.   

**cd_account.py | Modular File**     
Using an instance of the Account class, we pass in user input into to calculate interest earned on a customer's cd account and returns the interest earned and the updated account balance.    

## üåü Features 
| Feature  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **Customizable Settings**  | Allow users to set the tool based on their own metrics.  |
| **Multiple Account Support**  | Allow users to manage multiple accounts within one program.|
| **Agile Practices** | Use of a class and functions to promote readability, reusability, and encapsulation.|
| **Interactive GUI** | Visually appealing and easy for users to interact with program.|



## üìù Execution Steps
1. If you have not done so already, CLONE git repository:
`git clone https://github.com/ncmoliver/customer_banking.git`    
2. RUN **customer_banking.py** to start the program.</li>
3. üòâ Enjoy!
