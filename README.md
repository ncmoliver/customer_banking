<h2 > <b>Week 3 of Artifical Intelligence Bootcamp</b></h2>
<p>This week we were tasked using a Class in python to create a banking program that calculates interest earned based on a customer's input.</p>
<h2> üóÉÔ∏è Project Files </h2>

<p> This program contains 1 executable file and 3 modular files. </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>customer_banking.py | Executable </b></li>   
    The main project file which takes in user input and passes it through the class created in Account.py, which is imported into both cd_account.py and saving_account.py. Returning two values, the interest earned on the account and the updated acccount balance.
    <hr>
    <li><b>Account.py | Modular File</b></li>    
    Holds all banking account functions, used in for calculating interest and updating account balance.
    <li><b>savings_account.py | Modular File</b></li> 
    Using an instance of the Account class, we pass in user input into to calculate interest earned on a customer's savings account and returns the interest earned and the updated account balance.
    <li><b>cd_account.py | Modular File</b></li> Using an instance of the Account class, we pass in user input into to calculate interest earned on a customer's cd account and returns the interest earned and the updated account balance.

<h2> üåü Features </h2>
<b>Agile Practices</b> - Use of a class and functions to promote readability, reusability, and encapsulation.
<b>User-friendly</b> - Easy for users to interact with program.

<h2> üìù Execution Steps </h2>
