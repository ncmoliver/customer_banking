<p> <b>Week 3 of Artifical Bootcamp</b></p>
<p>This week we were tasked with creating a banking program that calculates interest earned based on a customer's input.</p>
<h2> :floppy_disk: Project Files </h2>

<p> This file contains 1 executable file and 3 modular files. </p>

<ul>
    <li><b>customer_banking.py | Executable </b> - The main project file which takes in user input and passes it through the class created in Account.py, which is imported into both cd_account.py and saving_account.py. Returning two values, the interest earned on the account and the updated acccount balance.</li>
    <li><b>Account.py | Modular File</b> - Holds all banking account functions, used in savings_account.py and cd_account.py</li>
    <li><b>savings_account.py | Modular File</b> - Passes in user input into the Account class defined in Account.py to calculate interest earned on a customer's savings account.</li>
    <li><b>cd_account.py | Modular File</b> - Passes in user input into the Account class defined in Account.py to calculate interest earned on a customer's cd account.</li>
</ul>
